## GoFood Customer Journey Breakdown

This is a mini project where I did a customer journey, in order to deeply understand GoFood's system from both the DA perspective and the Backend perspective. A complete understanding of the application itself will ease the process of gathering insights while maintaining proper workflow with other divisions. Thus, ensuring high precision for the entire analysis process.

## Spreadsheet - Retail Property Analysis with Regression Analysis

This is another mini project where I did an analysis to understand the business problem that this Retail Company has. Followed by doing a regression analysis to determine the price of each variable in order to achieve one of the purposes of the analysis, which is deciding the price of the retails for potential clients.

## SQL - Optimizing Clothing Categories Using BCG Matrix

Within this project, I used mainly SQL to do the analysis with the purpose of determining which brands/categories that need to be prioritized/de-prioritized to maximize the profit of the company. In order to achieve that, I did queries to find out the market share of each brand/category. And finally placed them in their own respective standardized BCG matrix.

## Python - Identifying Key Trends and Customer Segmentation

This is a project that I did with Google Colaboratory as its IDE to identify key trends and customer segmentation in a mutual fund startup. By doing the analysis in those directions, I'm able to create insights for other divisions to use in order to create an appropriate thematic campaign.

## Data Visualization - Brazilian E-commerce Dashboard

In this mini project, I did data visualization using Google Data Studio based on the objectives that the executives' level needs. The purposes and instructions for the dashboard are also detailed in the deck with the purpose of creating a simple but effective dashboard that's easy to use by the user. As a bonus, there are quick multiple insights that can be analyzed from the created dashboard.
